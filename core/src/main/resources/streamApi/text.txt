What is a spousal IRA?
As previously mentioned, spousal IRAs allow a working spouse to

contribute to the retirement of a non-working spouse
through an IRA. For example, many couples agree that one spouse will

stay home with the children while the other one works. In that case the stay-at-home spouse probably won’t have an active 401k plan, and they might not be eligible to contribute to their own IRA.

Thus, the current law allows the non-earning spouse to contribute to an IRA under certain conditions. One rule the IRS emphasizes is that your spousal IRA contributions cannot be greater than whichever total is smaller: your combined taxable income, or the annual IRA contribution limits: $6,000 for the year 2021, or $7,000 for savers age 50 and older.

That means your total combined IRA contributions cannot be greater than $12,000. If you are older than 50, that increases to $13,000, and if you and your spouse are both over 50, then it increases to $14,000. An easy way to remember it is that the working spouse’s contributions to the non-working spouse’s IRA simply replace what the non-working spouse’s contributions would be if they were working.

You can open two different forms of spousal IRA:

Traditional IRA: Traditional IRAs allow you to deposit money and then deduct your contributions on your taxes for that year. However, once you retire and begin withdrawing funds from the account, they are taxed as regular income.
Roth IRA: This type of IRA allows you to deposit post-tax income, and contributions are not tax-deductible. However, your withdrawals post-retirement will not be taxed as income.
